## Getting Started Locally

Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version **22.14.0**. We recommend using a version manager like [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).

  ```bash
  nvm use
  ```

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/10xWordUp.git
    cd 10xWordUp
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    This project uses npm as its package manager.

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**

    Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add the necessary environment variables for Supabase. You can get these from your Supabase project dashboard.

    ```env
    PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL="your-supabase-project-url"
    PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="your-supabase-anon-key"
